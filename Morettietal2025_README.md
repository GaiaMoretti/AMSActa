Abstract

This study introduces the design and assessment of a deep learning-based machine vision system for the real-time detection and classification of cucumber fruits grown under protected conditions in polytunnels. Greenhouse environments present unique challenges for automation, including fruit occlusion by foliage, overlapping structures, and inconsistent lighting. Precise identification of ripe and unripe cucumbers is vital for addressing labor shortages and maintaining harvest efficiency. To support model training, a tailored RGB image dataset was developed and used to train a YOLOv8-based detection framework, incorporating both pre- and post-processing techniques to enhance performance. Given the known limitations of occlusion in machine vision applications, the study investigated whether pruning practices—intended to improve fruit visibility—could enhance detection accuracy. The YOLOv8 model was trained and evaluated using two separate datasets: one representing unpruned (Control) cucumber plants and the other reflecting pruned (Pruned) conditions. Both datasets originated from high-wire cultivation systems. Results revealed similar mean average precision (mAP@0.5) scores for both treatments—87.6% for the control and 85.4% for the pruned dataset—indicating that pruning had minimal impact on detection outcomes. These findings suggest that altering plant architecture may not offer significant benefits either for vision-based fruit detection in protected cropping environments and in terms of productivity (yield). Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-driven solutions like YOLOv8 in addressing key challenges in automated harvesting and highlights their role in advancing precision agriculture technologies.

Content of the file

File Morettietal2025_dataset.csv contains one sheet where the agronomic variables are reported, indicating the treatment in the first column, the replicate in the second and the cumulative marketable yield in the third column.

File specifics

The file is in .csv format and can be used on several software (excel, R, Python, Matlab). The .csv file has the following specifics:
•	Character set UTF-8
•	Field delimiter « ; » (semicolon)


Notes 

The data are presented in the following publication:
Moretti, G., Orazi, F., Landolfo, M., Cerasola, V.A., Pennisi, G., Gianquinto G., Orsini, F., 2025. Development of a YOLOv8 algorithm for fruit detection in cucumber plants grown in polytunnel. Acta horticolturae.


Methodologies 

The experiment was realized between May and August 2025 (Bologna, Italy) in the simplified hydroponic system and traditional cultivation system described in the abstract. An experiment of three-block experimental design three-times replicated was implemented, where 4 growing substrates were tested in combination with the plant position in the bottle line and compared with a soil-based trial on the same variety. The system design is composed by 20 lines of plastic bottles, each featuring 10 bottles (and each hosting 2 plants, for a total of 20 plants per line). Blocks were represented by the bottle lines, while replicates were represented by three plants harvested at 35 days after transplanting (DAT).
The first and the last plant were not included in the data monitoring to mitigate the border effect.
